# Objective Extension Enhancements

This document summarizes the new features added to the Objective Extension, which helps users break down complex goals into manageable tasks and guides AI assistants to methodically complete them. These enhancements focus on improving user experience and providing more flexibility in managing tasks and objectives.

## Task Progress Visualization

The task progress visualization adds a progress bar that allows users to see the total number of tasks and percentage completion of the tasks in the existing task list at a glance, providing immediate feedback on objective progress.

- Displays the percentage of completed tasks in the current objective
- Shows a count of completed tasks vs. total tasks
- Updates dynamically as tasks are completed
- Provides visual feedback with a green progress bar that fills from left to right
- Includes appropriate spacing (20px bottom margin) to separate it from the task list

The progress bar appears automatically when tasks exist and is hidden when there are no tasks, ensuring a clean interface at all times.

## Task Import and Export

The import/export functionality allows users to save their task structures for backup or sharing, ensuring work isn't lost and can be transferred between different chats or instances.

- Export current tasks to a JSON file with a customizable filename
- User-friendly prompt allows specifying a custom name or accepting the suggested default
- Default filename is intelligently generated based on the objective description
- System ensures the .json extension is always included for proper file handling
- Import tasks from JSON files with proper validation
- Confirmation dialog when importing would replace existing tasks
- Maintains task hierarchy, descriptions, and structure during import/export
- Separate from template system, focused on current working tasks rather than reusable structures

## Task Templates Management

The template system enables users to save and reuse common task structures across different objectives, saving time and ensuring consistency when working on similar projects.

- Templates preserve the entire task structure including subtasks and hierarchies
- Users can save current tasks as a template with a custom name
- Templates can be previewed before loading to ensure they match requirements
- Individual templates can be exported to JSON files for sharing or backup
- Templates can be imported with intelligent conflict resolution (overwrite, rename, or skip)
- Exported files use meaningful names based on the template content

The template system integrates seamlessly with the UI through dedicated buttons for managing, exporting, and importing templates, with clear feedback messages for all operations.

## Additional Tasks Generation

The additional tasks generation feature allows users to expand their task list without starting over, enabling incremental development of objectives as the conversation progresses and new requirements emerge.

- The "Generate More Tasks" button appears only when there are existing tasks
- The system uses a specialized prompt that includes the existing tasks as context
- New tasks are numbered sequentially, continuing from the last existing task
- The AI is instructed to avoid repeating existing tasks
- The prompt supports the `{{existingTasks}}` variable to include the current task list

## Task Completion History and Statistics

The statistics system provides users with insights into their productivity and task completion patterns, helping them track progress over time and across different objectives.

- Records task completion events with timestamps
- Maintains a history of completed tasks (limited to the most recent 100 to manage metadata size)
- Provides statistics including:
  - Total tasks completed
  - Number of objectives completed
  - Date and time of the most recent completion
  - Current objective completion rate

### Global Statistics Tracking

The global statistics feature maintains a persistent record of all task activity across chats, giving users a comprehensive view of their productivity regardless of which conversation they're in.

- Statistics are stored in the extension settings rather than just in chat metadata
- Task completion counts are maintained globally, even if tasks are deleted
- The statistics UI now shows both chat-specific and global statistics
- Global statistics include:
  - Total tasks completed across all chats
  - Total objectives completed across all chats
  - Total tasks created across all chats
  - Date and time of the most recent completion globally

The statistics are accessible through a dedicated "Statistics" button that opens a popup showing:
- Current objective statistics (total tasks, completed tasks, completion rate)
- Current chat statistics (tasks completed, objectives completed, last completion date)
- Global statistics (total tasks completed, total objectives completed, total tasks created, last completion date)
- A list of the 10 most recently completed tasks with their descriptions, objective context, and completion dates
