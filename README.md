# SuperObjective

## What is it?

The SuperObjective extension lets you specify an objective for the AI to strive towards during your chat. This objective is broken down into step-by-step tasks that can be organized in a hierarchical structure. Tasks may be branched, where child tasks can be created automatically or manually, giving you the ability to create complex task trees.

This differs from static prompting by adding sequential and paced directives for the AI to follow without user intervention, creating a more genuine experience of the AI autonomously working toward a goal.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you've met the following prerequisites:

- Make sure you're on the latest version of SillyTavern
- Install the ST-SuperObjective extension using this link and the "Install extension" button on the extensions panel.

## Common Use Cases

Your imagination is the limit! You can give the AI any objective you wish, and it will plan out how to achieve it. Examples include:
- Planning how to slay a dragon
- Designing a marketing campaign
- Creating a detailed story outline
- Developing a business strategy
- Building a fictional world

## Usage Tips

### Current Task Selection

The current task will always be the first listed incomplete task. Any updates to tasks will trigger a check for what the current task should be. Tasks are selected depth-first, meaning all child tasks will be selected in order first, then continue down the list.

### Branch Tasks

Click the Branch Task button to set the current task as an objective where you can generate or manually create child tasks. You can continue to turn any child task into an objective to create deeper hierarchies.

### Hiding Tasks

If you want to remain unaware of what tasks the AI is attempting to complete, check the Hide Tasks box to hide the task list. For maximum mystery, do this before clicking Auto-Generate Tasks!

### Task Context Awareness

With the recently completed and upcoming tasks features, the AI maintains awareness of both past accomplishments and future goals, creating a more coherent and goal-directed conversation experience.

## Warning

Task checking happens in a separate API request. Setting Task Check Frequency to 1 will double your API calls to the LLM service. Be careful with this if you are using a paid service.
